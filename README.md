## Hi there 👋
### I am a junior Software Developer based in Kolkata, India. Welcome to my Github!

**Quick introduction.**
* I am currently working as Systems Engineer at [Tata Consultancy Services](https://www.tcs.com/).
* My responsibilities include server administration, creating and maintaining data collecting & processing pipelines, building backend APIs and more.
* I have done by Masters and Bachelors in Computer Science from [University of Calcutta](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/), where during my master's I specialized in deep learning, specifically researching computer vision and AI-assisted solutions to medical imaging.

* I love building stuffs, sometimes they work, sometimes they barely work. But the serotonin rush from finally having an idea come to conception is worth it. However I especially love working with data, be it data collection, wrangling, analytics, or interfacing with databases to build RESTful APIs, and sometimes feeding data to our AI overlords.

* Apart from coding, I also like to read, sketch, write. Speaking of writing, check out my [blog](http://s-bose.github.io/)

I have been recently getting into Data Science and constantly exploring new and interesting ideas. I love the open source community and try to do my best in keeping my productivity juices flowing, learning more each day
and implementing new projects to help myself and others.
